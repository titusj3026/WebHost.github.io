# Notes
* Don't put alot of gameIds (if you do you need to optimise the checker.)
* UI will not work on phones (too small)
* The blur on the game page can lag bad end PCs (or just chrome)

# WIPs
- [x] Add custom embed config
- [x] Adding credits to me
- [ ] Try and optimise code
- [ ] Add a update detecter (will add msg when I release a new update) (close)
